With the impending TikTok ban set for Sunday, January 19, 2025, I wanted to share some insights from my journey on the platform. If you're reading this, chances are you found me through TikTok.

But first (IYKYK); a little bit of background...

I began posting on TikTok on October 30, 2023, after discovering the "TechTok" community—a engaging, organically formed group of tech enthusiasts spanning various disciplines, including Information Security, Networking, Cloud Engineering, DevSecOps, Infrastructure, and Sales Engineering. This welcoming community actively interacted with one another through comments, shares, and stitches of tech-related videos.

My objectives as a creator were:

1. To network with like-minded individuals
2. To participate in tech-related memes
3. To share valuable insights on Identity and IT
4. To enhance my public speaking skills


Before I share some fun metrics; please know that I was quite literally "winging it" and honestly that's what made this fun.  Youtube and IG feel very polished and have often have decent production value.  As I consider increasing my presence on these platforms, I feel the need to produce more refined content. While becoming an influencer isn't my goal, reaching like-minded individuals is essential for rebuilding a sense of community.

Here are some fun metrics I screenshot before the service went down:

I hope to continue the connections I've made along the way on any platform that will have us. It's critically important to have a group in your industry or field where you can bounce questions off of each other, discuss challenges, and sometimes just vent. Having a support network is invaluable in both personal and professional growth.

If you've ever thought about posting content to social media, regardless of your field, I encourage you to do it—start yesterday! When I look back at my first video, it's hands-down the cringiest thing I've ever recorded. But hey, we all have to start somewhere. My friends would probably still say I'm cringey, but you know what? That's just me. 😄

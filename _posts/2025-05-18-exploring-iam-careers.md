## 🔐 Introduction

When people say they “work in Identity,” it can mean a lot of different things, and that’s what makes this field both interesting and confusing for those just starting out. Identity and Access Management (IAM) is about making sure the right people and systems have access to the right things, and nothing more. That might sound simple, but in practice it spans everything from handling logins and managing accounts to enforcing security policies across thousands of users and applications.

This post breaks down the types of IAM jobs that exist today; some technical, some operational, some focused on governance or cloud - and outlines what skills are helpful for each. I also included examples pulled from real job listings to show how these roles show up in the wild. If you’re curious about IAM, switching roles, or just figuring out where to start, I hope this gives you a useful jumping-off point.

> 👥 **Workforce vs Customer Identity**
> 
> The role breakdowns in this article mostly focus on **Workforce IAM**, which covers access for employees, contractors, service accounts, etc.  
>
> **Customer IAM (CIAM)** involves many of the same tools and titles, but the work is centered on user sign-up flows, privacy, consent, and fraud protection for external users. I'm not breaking every role out by identity type, but it’s worth knowing the difference as you explore this space.

## 🔍 A Quick Note on Role Scope

In larger organizations, you’ll often find specialized IAM roles like the ones described below, each focused on a specific area such as governance, engineering, or architecture. In medium or smaller companies, these responsibilities are often combined into hybrid roles. For example, instead of a dedicated Identity and Access Management Administrator, you might see a System Administrator or Cloud Engineer managing access control as part of their broader responsibilities. Job titles and scopes can vary depending on company size, team structure, and priorities.

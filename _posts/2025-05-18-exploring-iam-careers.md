## Introduction

When people say they “work in Identity,” it can mean a lot of different things, and that’s what makes this field both interesting and confusing for those just starting out. Identity and Access Management (IAM) is about making sure the right people and systems have access to the right things, and nothing more. That might sound simple, but in practice it spans everything from handling logins and managing accounts to enforcing security policies across thousands of users and applications.

This post breaks down the types of IAM jobs that exist today; some technical, some operational, some focused on governance or cloud - and outlines what skills are helpful for each. I also included examples pulled from real job listings to show how these roles show up in the wild. If you’re curious about IAM, switching roles, or just figuring out where to start, I hope this gives you a useful jumping-off point.
